# Group member: Jia Guo, Yuyang Xiao, Junyong Cao
  Jia Guo writes the code in group1_final_project.ipynb except for the plot in Exploratory Data Analysis and provides content in group1_final_presentation.pptx except for the 8th page in the powerpoint
  Yuyang Xiao does Exploratory Data Analysis and write coresponding code and provide content in 8th page in the powerpoint
  Junyong Cao gives valuable suggestion on result analysis 

# dataset
   train.csv is the trainingset of titanic dataset 
   test.csv is the testset of titanic dataset
# our solution 
  group1_final_presentation.pptx is the powerpoint we present in the presentation
  group1_final_project.ipynb is all our code
  Submission.csv is the predict result using sklearn gradientboost which got 0.79425 in Kaggle
  Submission2.csv is the predict result using our own implemented gradientboost which got 0.76555 in Kagle
